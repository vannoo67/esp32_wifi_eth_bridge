# ESP32 Ethernet Router

Firmware for the **[WT32-ETH01](https://github.com/egnor/wt32-eth01)** board (and boards with a W5500 ethernet module) that turns it into a compact network router. 

**Derived from** [esp32_nat_router](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp32_nat_router). The original project uses WiFi as the downlink (AP) and (as one option) Ethernet as the uplink. This variant reverses that: **WiFi STA is the uplink** (Internet) and **Ethernet is the downlink** (LAN). If you are looking for a plain ESP32 **Ethernet AP** (Layer 2 bridge), check out [esp32_eth_wifi_bridge](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp32_eth_wifi_bridge) — note that project bridges in the opposite direction (Ethernet uplink, WiFi AP downlink) and can't be used for the WiFi-STA-uplink topology this project targets. For that topology, this router's **Bridged mode** (below) is the closest equivalent to transparent bridging that's achievable given the constraints of a WiFi client association.

The board connects to an existing WiFi network as a client (STA) and shares that connection with wired devices through its Ethernet port. Two operating modes are available for the Ethernet side: **Routed** (its own IP subnet, with optional DHCP server and optional NAT) or **Bridged** (Ethernet devices join the main WiFi network directly, with real addresses, via proxy-ARP and DHCP relay — no static routes or port forwarding needed to reach them from the main network).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp32_ethernet_router/refs/heads/main/esp32_ethernet_router_topo.png">

In **Routed** mode (the default), all traffic from Ethernet clients is NATed through the router's WiFi uplink address, so the upstream network sees only a single client. NAT can be disabled for routed (non-NATed) operation if the upstream network knows the `192.168.4.0/24` subnet. In **Bridged** mode, Ethernet clients instead get real addresses from the main network's own DHCP server and are directly reachable from any host on the main WiFi — closer to how a commercial WiFi range extender behaves. A WireGuard VPN tunnel can optionally replace or supplement the direct uplink path, with a kill switch that blocks unprotected traffic when the tunnel is down.

All settings are managed through a browser-based web interface or via the serial console at 115200 bps. After boot the router is reachable by name at `http://esp32-eth-router.local` (or whatever hostname is configured) from any LAN client that supports mDNS — no need to look up the IP.

## Use Cases

- **Home lab gateway** — connect a wired lab segment to a WiFi network without a dedicated router
- **Isolated test network** — provide controlled Internet access to an IoT net segment protected by ACLs
- **Transparent monitoring tap** — capture and inspect all traffic on the wired segment in Wireshark without any client changes
- **WPA2-Enterprise bridge** — give plain devices access to a corporate WiFi that requires 802.1X authentication
- **VPN Gateway** — connect a LAN segment upstream via a protected VPN tunnel
- **Routed segment (no NAT)** — operate as a pure IP router, forwarding traffic between the WiFi uplink and the Ethernet segment without address translation
- **Transparent WiFi extension (Bridged mode)** — extend WiFi coverage to a wired segment where devices need to appear on the main network with real, directly-reachable addresses, similar to a commercial WiFi range extender

---

## Features

- WiFi STA uplink with automatic reconnect on disconnect
- WPA2-Personal and WPA2-Enterprise (PEAP, TTLS, TLS) on the uplink
- Configurable static IP or DHCP for the WiFi uplink
- Ethernet LAN downlink with configurable IP
- **Bridged mode** — transparent same-subnet extension via proxy-ARP and DHCP relay; Ethernet clients get real addresses from the main network and are directly reachable, no static routes needed
- NAT (NAPT) — enable or disable per configuration when in Routed mode; when disabled the Ethernet segment is routed
- DHCP server on Ethernet — enable or disable independently of NAT (Routed mode only; Bridged mode relays DHCP to the main network instead)
- DHCP reservations — assign fixed IPs to clients by MAC address
- Port forwarding (DNAT) — forward external TCP/UDP ports to internal hosts
- Stateless packet firewall with four directional ACL lists, 16 rules each
- Packet capture to Wireshark over TCP (PCAP streaming, ACL-triggered or promiscuous)
- WireGuard VPN client with kill switch and split-tunnel / route-all modes
- Remote console — password-protected TCP CLI on a configurable port
- Syslog forwarding — ship ESP log output to a remote syslog server via UDP
- NetFlow v5 exporter — export per-client flow records to any NetFlow collector (ntopng, nfdump, Grafana)
- OTA firmware update through the web interface
- Byte counters for the WiFi uplink
- Configurable TTL override, WiFi TX power, and timezone
- mDNS responder — router reachable as `<hostname>.local` from any LAN client
- MQTT / Home Assistant integration — publish telemetry and WoL buttons to HA (opt-in, ~58 KB flash)
- Boot-button factory reset — hold the BOOT button (GPIO9) for 5 s to erase all settings (C3 SuperMini only)
- All settings persisted in NVS flash; survive firmware updates

## Hardware — W5500 + ESP32-C3

As a hardware alternative the router can run on an **ESP32-C3** with an external **W5500 SPI Ethernet module**. It uses SPI to send and receive ethernet frames, so the SPI clock frequency is critical here. There are precompiled binaries for an **ESP32-C3 SuperMini** board with the SPI connections as given below. If your setup differs, adjust the config.

**Caution:** The WiFi signal on an **ESP32-C3 SuperMini** board is sometimes critical due to antenna issues. Typical symptoms can be, that you cannot connect to an AP correctly, even if you see it in a scan. Consider LOWERING the TX power with e.g. `set_tx_power 15`, as the signal gets distorted under max gain. If this doesn't help, search also the internet for possible DIY antenna fixes.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| SoC | ESP32-C3 (single-core RISC-V, 160 MHz) |
| Flash | 4 MB |
| Ethernet | W5500 (SPI, 10/100 Mbit/s) |
| Console | USB-JTAG (SuperMini) or UART (DevKit-M-1) |

### Wiring

Pin assignments are configurable via `idf.py menuconfig` → *Ethernet Downlink*.

The following setup is known to work and uses the C3's native SPI pins:

| W5500 Pin | ESP32-C3 GPIO | Function |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| GND | GND | Ground |
| 3.3V / VCC | 3V3 | Power |
| MISO | GPIO 5 | SPI Data In |
| MOSI | GPIO 6 | SPI Data Out |
| SCLK | GPIO 4 | SPI Clock |
| SCS (CS) | GPIO 7 | SPI Chip Select |
| INT | GPIO 3 | Interrupt |
| RST | GPIO 2 | Hardware Reset |

### Build

```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
idf.py set-target esp32c3
idf.py -B build_w5500_c3 \
  -D SDKCONFIG=sdkconfig.w5500_c3 \
  -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.defaults.w5500_c3" \
  build
```

### Flash

```bash
idf.py -B build_w5500_c3 -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor   # SuperMini (USB-JTAG)
idf.py -B build_w5500_c3 -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor   # DevKit-M-1 (UART)
```

### Notes

- You may adapt the settings via `menuconfig` or directly in sdkconfig.defaults.w5500_c3 to adapt for other ESP32 types and boards with a W5500.
- The W5500 draws up to 250 mA, way to much for the SuperMini's internal 3.3V voltage regulator. Use an external power supply for the W5500.
- The W5500 module has no factory MAC address. The firmware derives one automatically from the ESP32-C3's base MAC.
- The onboard LED on the SuperMini (typically GPIO 8) can be configured via `set_led_gpio 8`.
- SPI clock defaults to 25 MHz. Increase via `set_spi_clock` if wiring is short and clean; decrease if you see SPI errors (`show status` shows SPI error counters).
- **Boot-button factory reset:** Hold the **BOOT button (GPIO9)** for 5 seconds at any time to erase all NVS settings and reboot. The LED blinks rapidly and the LED strip (if configured) turns red during the countdown. This is the recovery path if the router is misconfigured and neither serial nor the web interface is reachable. Not available on the WT32-ETH01 (GPIO0 is used by the Ethernet clock).

## Web Interface

Access the web interface from any device connected to the Ethernet LAN. The default address is `http://192.168.4.1`.

### Pages

**/ — Status**

Shows current connection state: uplink SSID, uplink IP, signal strength, Ethernet Mode (Routed / Bridged), Ethernet IP, VPN status (when a tunnel is configured), packet capture mode (when active), byte counters, and uptime. When a web password is set, the login form appears here.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp32_ethernet_router/refs/heads/main/UI_index.png">

**Configuration**

Grouped into sections. Changes trigger a reboot to apply.

- *Ethernet Subnet Settings* — LAN IP address, DNS server override, **Mode** selector (Routed / Bridged). NAT toggle, DHCP server toggle, and (Bridged mode only) ARP timeout are shown or hidden depending on the selected mode — NAT and DHCP server are only meaningful in Routed mode and are automatically disabled when Bridged is selected
- *WiFi Settings (Uplink)* — SSID, password, WPA2-Enterprise credentials (username, identity, EAP method, TTLS phase 2, certificate options), MAC address override
- *Static IP Settings* — static IP, subnet mask, gateway for the WiFi uplink; leave empty to use DHCP
- *Remote Console* — enable/disable, port, interface binding (ETH/STA/VPN), idle timeout
- *Device Management* — OTA firmware upload, factory reset
- *Web UI Settings* — Access to the web UI

**Monitoring**

Monitoring and diagnostics tools, password-protected.

- *PCAP Packet Capture* — capture mode (off / ACL monitor / promiscuous), snaplen, live stats
- *NetFlow v5 Exporter* — ingress / egress direction checkboxes, collector IP and port, idle and active flow timeouts, live stats; leave collector empty to disable
- *Syslog* — remote syslog server address and UDP port; leave server empty to disable

**Mappings**

Visible only when DHCP server or NAT is enabled.

- *Connected Clients* — live DHCP lease table (shown when DHCP server is enabled)
- *DHCP Reservations* — add or remove static MAC-to-IP assignments (shown when DHCP server is enabled)
- *Port Forwarding* — add or remove TCP/UDP port forward rules (shown when NAT is enabled)

**Firewall**

Manage the four ACL lists. Add rules by selecting direction, protocol, source address/port, destination address/port, and action. Delete rules by index. Per-rule hit counters show traffic statistics.

**VPN**

WireGuard peer configuration: private key, peer public key, optional preshared key, endpoint, tunnel IP, keepalive, kill switch, and routing mode.

**WiFi Scan**

Scans for available upstream networks and displays SSID, BSSID, channel, RSSI, and authentication type.

### Password Protection

Set a password with `set_router_password <password>` or through the web interface. When set, the Configuration, Mappings, Firewall, VPN, and Monitoring pages require authentication. Sessions last 30 minutes. Clear the password by setting an empty string.

---

## WiFi and Network

### Uplink (WiFi STA)

```
set_sta <ssid> <password>
set_sta_static <ip> <subnet> <gateway>
set_sta_static dhcp
set_sta_mac <AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF>
set_tx_power <dBm>
set_wifi_country <CC>
```

The router connects to the upstream WiFi network and reconnects immediately on disconnect. WPA2-Enterprise (PEAP/TTLS/TLS) can be configured in the web interface.

### Ethernet Downlink

```
set_ap_ip <ip>
set_ap_dns <dns>
set_eth_mode <routed|bridged>
set_eth_nat <on|off>
set_eth_dhcps <on|off>
set_eth_dhcpc <on|off>
set_arp_timeout <seconds>
```

The Ethernet interface defaults to `192.168.4.1/24`, **Routed** mode, with NAT and DHCP server enabled. Changes to mode, NAT, or DHCP server state take effect after reboot.

When NAT is disabled (Routed mode), the Ethernet segment is routed — clients use their own IP addresses, and the router forwards packets to the default gateway (WiFi uplink or VPN tunnel).

When DHCP server is disabled (Routed mode), clients must be configured with static IPs in the `192.168.4.x` range (or whatever subnet you set).

#### Bridged Mode (Transparent Extension)

`set_eth_mode bridged` switches the Ethernet downlink from a separate routed subnet to a transparent extension of the main WiFi network — Ethernet devices get real addresses from the **main network's own DHCP server** and are directly reachable from any host on that network, with no static routes, port forwarding, or manual configuration needed. This is the closest equivalent to what a commercial WiFi range extender does, adapted for a WiFi-STA-uplink topology where true Layer 2 bridging isn't possible (a WiFi client association is inherently bound to a single MAC address, so ordinary bridging can't work in this direction — see the note in the introduction above).

The ARP-table and proxy-ARP handling logic is derived from [parprouted](https://github.com/Adellica/parprouted) (used with the original author's consent — see `LICENSE`).

The mechanism has two parts:

- **Proxy-ARP routing** — custom `LWIP_HOOK_IP4_ROUTE_SRC` and `LWIP_HOOK_ETHARP_GET_GW` hooks route traffic to individually-learned hosts and answer ARP requests on their behalf across the WiFi/Ethernet boundary, learned live from ARP traffic on both interfaces.
- **DHCP relay** — an RFC 1542-style relay agent forwards DHCP requests from Ethernet-side devices to the main network's DHCP server (assumed to be the WiFi uplink's own default gateway) and relays replies back, so devices get addresses in the main subnet rather than from a local DHCP server.

Selecting Bridged mode **forces NAT and the DHCP server off** (both are incompatible with transparent bridging) — this only affects the in-memory state; their persisted settings are left untouched, so switching back to Routed mode restores whatever was configured before.

**Bridged mode and DHCP-client mode (`set_eth_dhcpc`) are mutually exclusive** — DHCP-client mode turns the Ethernet port into the router's own uplink connection, leaving no downstream devices to bridge. `set_eth_mode bridged` refuses to apply while DHCP-client mode is enabled, and vice versa; a boot-time check also falls back to Routed mode if both are somehow persisted as enabled at once.

`set_arp_timeout <seconds>` controls how long a learned proxy-ARP entry stays valid before expiring (10–86400, default 300). Unlike the mode/NAT/DHCP settings, this applies immediately with no reboot required. Entries are checked for expiry roughly every 30 seconds; a device that goes quiet longer than the timeout is re-discovered automatically the next time something tries to reach it, at the cost of one extra ARP round-trip.

`show arptab` lists currently-learned proxy-ARP entries (IP, interface, MAC, age); only meaningful in Bridged mode.

#### Ethernet Uplink / DHCP-Client Mode

`set_eth_dhcpc on` inverts the Ethernet role: instead of a static LAN downlink, the Ethernet port becomes a **DHCP client** that obtains its IP, gateway, and DNS from an upstream router. This is for topologies where the WiFi STA connects to an isolated device AP and the Ethernet port faces the main home network.

When enabled, the DHCP server is forced off (server and client are mutually exclusive on one interface), the Ethernet interface becomes the device's default route, and NAT (if enabled) masquerades Ethernet→STA traffic to the STA's IP. The mode is off by default and takes effect after reboot. **Mutually exclusive with Bridged mode** (above) — `set_eth_dhcpc on` refuses to apply while Bridged mode is active, since DHCP-client mode leaves no downstream Ethernet devices to bridge.

For home clients to reach a device behind the WiFi STA, the home router still needs a static route for that subnet pointing at the ESP32's Ethernet IP; give the ESP32 a DHCP reservation on the home router so the next-hop stays stable.

### DHCP Reservations

```
dhcp_reserve add <AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF> <ip> [-n <name>]
dhcp_reserve del <AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF>
```

Reservations persist in NVS and are shown in the Mappings page. Up to 16 reservations are supported.

### Port Forwarding

```
portmap add TCP <external_port> <internal_ip> <internal_port>
portmap add UDP <external_port> <internal_ip> <internal_port>
portmap del TCP <external_port>
portmap del UDP <external_port>
```

Only available when NAT is enabled. Rules persist in NVS.

### Wake-on-LAN (CLI)

```
wol <AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF>
wol <device-name>                      # resolved from a DHCP reservation name
wol <AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF> -i <ip>        # unicast to a specific host instead of broadcast
wol <AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF> -p <port>      # alternate UDP port (default 9)
wol <AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF> -I sta         # send via WiFi uplink instead of Ethernet downlink
```

Sends a WoL magic packet to the given MAC address. Accepts a DHCP reservation name instead of a raw MAC address to look up the target. The packet goes out the **Ethernet downlink** by default — binding to the ETH interface IP ensures the broadcast reaches LAN clients instead of leaking to the WiFi uplink. Use `-I sta` to send via the WiFi uplink instead. The packet is transmitted three times with 100 ms between each send to improve delivery reliability over UDP. Both `:` and `-` MAC separators are accepted.

### Wake-on-LAN (Web Interface)

Every DHCP reservation in the **Mappings** page has a **Wake** button next to the **Delete** button. Clicking it sends a WoL magic packet (`255.255.255.255:9`, via the Ethernet downlink) to the device's MAC address. The web interface does not support custom destination IP, port, or interface binding — use the CLI for those options.

### Other Network Settings

```
set_hostname <name>
set_ttl <value>
set_tz <POSIX TZ string>
set_tz clear
```

`set_ttl` overrides the TTL field in forwarded packets, which can help with tethering restrictions. `set_tz` accepts a POSIX timezone string (e.g. `CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3`).

---

## Firewall

The firewall filters packets at four points in the data path:

| List | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `to_esp` | inbound on WiFi uplink | packets arriving from the Internet |
| `from_esp` | outbound on WiFi uplink | packets leaving to the Internet |
| `from_eth` | inbound on Ethernet | packets arriving from LAN clients |
| `to_eth` | outbound on Ethernet | packets going to LAN clients |

Rules are evaluated in order; the first match wins. Unmatched packets are allowed by default.

### Rule Syntax (CLI)

```
acl <list> <proto> <src> [<s_port>] <dst> [<d_port>] <action>
acl <list> del <index>
acl <list> clear
acl <list> clear_stats
acl show [<list>]
```

**proto:** `IP`, `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`

**address:** CIDR notation (`192.168.0.0/24`), single IP, or `any`; named DHCP reservations can be used by device name

**port:** port number or `*` for any (TCP/UDP only)

**action:** `allow`, `deny`, `allow_monitor`, `deny_monitor`

The `_monitor` variants also send the matching packet to the PCAP capture stream, regardless of the global capture mode setting.

### Example

Drop all inbound TCP to the router's web port and block LAN clients from reaching the router management interface:

```
acl to_esp TCP any * any 80 deny
acl from_eth TCP any * 192.168.4.1 80 deny
```

Rules are stored in NVS under keys `acl_0` through `acl_3`.

---

## Packet Capture

Traffic on the Ethernet interface can be streamed live to Wireshark over a TCP connection on port 19000. No client software other than netcat and Wireshark is required.

### Capture Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `off` | No capture |
| `acl` | Capture only packets matched by a `_monitor` ACL rule |
| `promisc` | Capture all Ethernet interface traffic |

### Usage

```
pcap <off|acl|promisc>
pcap snaplen [<bytes>]
pcap status
```

Connect from a workstation on the LAN:

```
nc 192.168.4.1 19000 | wireshark -k -i -
```

The connection command is also shown in the PCAP section of the Monitoring page. Snaplen limits the captured bytes per packet (64–1600, default 1600).

---

## WireGuard VPN

The router includes a WireGuard client that establishes a tunnel over the WiFi uplink. The VPN tunnel can be used as the default gateway for all Ethernet clients.

### Configuration (CLI)

```
set_vpn private_key <base64 key>
set_vpn public_key <base64 key>
set_vpn preshared_key <base64 key>
set_vpn endpoint <host>
set_vpn port <udp_port>
set_vpn address <tunnel_ip>
set_vpn netmask <netmask>
set_vpn keepalive <seconds>
set_vpn killswitch <on|off>
set_vpn route_all <on|off>
set_vpn <on|off>
```

### Options

**Kill switch** (`killswitch on`): blocks Ethernet client Internet traffic when the VPN tunnel is down, preventing unprotected traffic from leaking through the plain WiFi uplink.

**Route all** (`route_all on`): sends all client traffic through the VPN tunnel. When disabled (split-tunnel), only traffic destined for the VPN peer subnet is routed through the tunnel; all other traffic uses the WiFi uplink directly.

VPN status (connected / disconnected) is shown on the index page when a tunnel is configured.

---

## Remote Console

A TCP server provides a password-authenticated CLI session accessible over the network. It reuses the web interface password. Output from CLI commands is captured and forwarded to the remote session.

```
remote_console enable
remote_console disable
remote_console port <port>
remote_console bind <eth|sta|vpn[,...]>
remote_console timeout <seconds>
remote_console kick
remote_console status
```

Default port is 2323. Connect with any TCP client:

```
nc 192.168.4.1 2323
```

The service is disabled by default. A web password must be set before enabling it. Idle sessions are disconnected after the configured timeout (default 300 seconds; 0 disables the timeout). Only one session is active at a time.

The `bind` option controls which network interfaces the server listens on (ETH = Ethernet downlink, STA = WiFi uplink, VPN = WireGuard tunnel). Multiple interfaces can be specified comma-separated, e.g. `eth,sta`.

---

## Syslog

ESP log output can be forwarded to a remote syslog server over UDP.

```
syslog enable <server> [<port>]
syslog disable
syslog status
```

The default port is 514. The server address is resolved by DNS and re-resolved each time the WiFi uplink connects. Configuration is persisted in NVS.

---

## NetFlow

The router exports per-client flow records in **NetFlow v5** format to a UDP collector. Two capture directions are selectable independently:

- **Ingress** — packets arriving from Ethernet clients. Because this is the pre-NAT path, the source IP is the real LAN client address (e.g. `192.168.4.x`), not the masqueraded ESP32 IP.
- **Egress** — packets leaving toward Ethernet clients (post-NAT responses).

Either or both directions can be enabled simultaneously. Each flow is a unidirectional 5-tuple (src IP, dst IP, protocol, src port, dst port). Flows are exported when they go idle (no packets for `idle_timeout` seconds) or reach the active timeout, whichever comes first.

```
netflow enable <collector-ip> [<port>] [ingress|egress|both]  # enable exporter (default: port 2055, ingress)
netflow disable                          # disable and free flow table RAM
netflow direction <ingress|egress|both>  # change direction while enabled
netflow collector <ip> [<port>]          # change collector without full disable/enable
netflow timeout idle <seconds>           # idle flow timeout (default 60 s)
netflow timeout active <seconds>         # active flow timeout (default 300 s)
netflow show                             # print active flow table
netflow status                           # show configuration and statistics
```

The flow table is allocated only while NetFlow is enabled (8 KB on ESP32, 4 KB on ESP32-C3). Configuration is persisted in NVS (`nf_dir` key stores the direction bitmask). The NetFlow section in the Monitoring page provides the same settings through the web interface.

Compatible collectors include **ntopng**, **nfdump/nfcapd**, **pmacct**, **Grafana Alloy**, and any other tool that accepts NetFlow v5 UDP datagrams.

---

## mDNS

After boot the router announces itself on the LAN via mDNS (Bonjour). Clients that support mDNS — macOS, Linux with avahi, Windows 10+, iOS, Android — can reach the web interface and ping the router by name without knowing its IP address.

The default hostname is `esp32-eth-router`, making the router reachable at:

```
http://esp32-eth-router.local
```

Change the hostname with:

```
set_hostname <name>
```

The mDNS `_http._tcp` service is registered automatically when the web interface is enabled, so clients can discover the router with a service browser as well.

---

## MQTT / Home Assistant

The router can publish telemetry to an MQTT broker with Home Assistant auto-discovery. When enabled, HA automatically creates a device with the following entities:

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Uplink Status | binary_sensor | WiFi uplink connected / disconnected |
| Connected Clients | sensor | Number of DHCP clients |
| Bytes Sent / Received | sensor | Cumulative bytes through the WiFi uplink |
| Free Heap | sensor | Available heap memory |
| Uptime | sensor | Seconds since boot |
| Uplink RSSI | sensor | WiFi signal strength |
| Uplink SSID | sensor | Connected upstream network name |
| Restart | button | Reboot the router |
| Web UI | switch | Enable / disable the web interface |
| Remote Console | switch | Enable / disable the TCP console |
| Wake \<name\> | button | One per named DHCP reservation — sends a WoL magic packet |

The WoL buttons let you wake any device whose MAC address is in the DHCP reservation list, directly from the HA dashboard or automations.

### Enable

MQTT is **disabled by default** (saves ~58 KB flash, important on the C3). Enable it in menuconfig:

```bash
idf.py -B build_w5500_c3 menuconfig   # MQTT Home Assistant → Enable
```

Then build and flash.

### Configure (CLI)

```
mqtt broker <uri>            # e.g. mqtt://192.168.1.2 or mqtt://user:pass@host
mqtt user <username> <pass>  # optional: set credentials separately
mqtt interval <seconds>      # publish interval, 5–3600 (default 30)
mqtt enable                  # connect to broker and start publishing
mqtt disable                 # disconnect
mqtt status                  # show connection state and settings
mqtt rediscover              # re-publish HA discovery configs (e.g. after adding a reservation)
```

Settings are persisted in NVS. The broker URI and credentials are stored under keys `mqtt_uri`, `mqtt_user`, `mqtt_pass`.

### WoL buttons

Each DHCP reservation that has a name (`dhcp_reserve add <mac> <ip> -n <name>`) gets a corresponding `button` entity in HA. Pressing it sends a WoL magic packet to that MAC address via the Ethernet downlink. Add or remove reservations and run `mqtt rediscover` to update HA.

---

## Building

Requires ESP-IDF v5.x. Source the ESP-IDF environment, then build for your target hardware.

### WT32-ETH01 (ESP32 + LAN8720)

```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
./build_firmware.sh
```

The script performs a clean build and copies the four binary files into the `firmware/` directory. To reconfigure build options:

```bash
idf.py -B build_eth_sta menuconfig
```

### W5500 + ESP32-C3

```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
./build_firmware_w5500_c3.sh
```

The script performs a clean build and copies the four binary files into the `firmware_w5500_c3/` directory. To reconfigure build options:

```bash
idf.py -B build_w5500_c3 menuconfig
```

### Configuration files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sdkconfig.defaults` | Shared base config (IP forwarding, NAPT, DHCP server) |
| `sdkconfig.defaults.wt32_eth_sta_uplink` | WT32-ETH01 Ethernet PHY GPIOs (LAN8720) |
| `sdkconfig.defaults.w5500_c3` | W5500 SPI pins, ESP32-C3 specifics, IRAM/perf tuning |

Each variant uses a separate sdkconfig file (`sdkconfig` vs `sdkconfig.w5500_c3`) so both can coexist in the same project directory.

OTA updates are also supported through the web interface (Device Management section) with partition rollback on failed updates.

---

## Installation

### WT32-ETH01 (ESP32)

Flash the binaries from the `firmware/` directory using `esptool.py`:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash \
  0x1000  firmware/bootloader.bin \
  0x8000  firmware/partition-table.bin \
  0xf000  firmware/ota_data_initial.bin \
  0x20000 firmware/esp32_eth_router.bin
```

To wipe the entire flash:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
```

### W5500 + ESP32-C3

Flash the binaries from the `firmware_w5500_c3/` directory:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash \
  0x0000  firmware_w5500_c3/bootloader.bin \
  0x8000  firmware_w5500_c3/partition-table.bin \
  0xf000  firmware_w5500_c3/ota_data_initial.bin \
  0x20000 firmware_w5500_c3/esp32_eth_router.bin
```

Note: use `/dev/ttyUSB0` for a DevKit-M-1 (UART) or `/dev/ttyACM0` for a SuperMini (USB-JTAG). The ESP32-C3 bootloader address is `0x0000`, not `0x1000` — using the wrong address will require a full flash erase to recover.

To wipe the entire flash:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 erase_flash
```

### First Boot

After flashing either variant, connect via serial at 115200 bps and configure the upstream WiFi:

```
set_sta MyWiFiSSID MyPassword
```

The router will reboot and connect. Access the web interface at `http://192.168.4.1` (or `http://esp32-eth-router.local` via mDNS) from a device connected to the Ethernet port.

To erase all settings and return to defaults:

```
factory_reset
```
